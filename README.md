To be written by me ...

All of this is under construction! DO NOT USE AT THE MOMENT!
This Project is set to public cause I need an easyway to download and test on different machines, but I would consider it private as of now.
As soon as things are tested somewhat OK I´ll add a propper description and flag it as such here!
